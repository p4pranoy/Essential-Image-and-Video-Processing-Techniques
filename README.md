This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Essential Image and Video Processing Techniques.ipynb`) that explores **essential image and video processing techniques** using **OpenCV** in Python.

## Project Overview

This notebook provides practical examples of fundamental operations for handling both images and video streams. It covers topics from basic image loading and color space conversions to reading, processing, and writing video frames.

## Key Highlights

  * **Image Handling**: Learn to load, display, and convert color spaces of images (e.g., BGR to RGB).
  * **Video Processing**: Understand how to read frames from a video, add dynamic text overlays, and save processed video content.
  * **OpenCV Integration**: Demonstrates core functionalities of the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need to have Python and the `opencv-python` library installed. If you are using Google Colab, `cv2_imshow` is used for displaying images.

You can install OpenCV via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### How to Run

1.  Ensure you have sample image files (e.g., `Apple.jpeg` as suggested by the notebook content) and optionally a video file if you plan to run the video processing sections. Update the file paths within the notebook as needed.

2.  Open the notebook using Jupyter:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Essential Image and Video Processing Techniques.ipynb"
    ```

3.  Execute the cells sequentially to observe the image and video processing techniques in action.
